# Approach 3. Error-First Callbacks
This next approach is a widespread pattern in Node.js that you will already have encountered, for example when using the `fs` module. It is one of the ways that we can deal with errors that are generated during asynchronous processes in Node.js.

We can implement this pattern by requiring a third argument to be passed to `applyToInteger`, which will be a callback function that is executed both in the case where an operational error has occurred, _and_ when the operation completes successfully.

* In the error case, the callback is executed with an `Error` object as its only argument.
* In the success case, the callback is executed with `null` as its first argument and the result as its second argument

## Example
```js
const applyToInteger = (func, integer, callback) => {
  if (typeof func !== 'function') {
    callback(new TypeError('Invalid argument: First argument is not a function'));
  }
  else if (! Number.isInteger(integer)) {
    callback(new TypeError(`Invalid argument: Second argument ${integer} is not an integer`));
  }
  else {
    callback(null, func(integer));
  }
};

const applyAndPrintResult = (func, integer) => {
  applyToInteger(func, integer, (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log('Sorry, result could not be calculated:');
      console.log(err.message);
    } else {
      console.log('Result successfully calculated:');
      console.log(`Applying ${func.name} to ${integer} gives ${result}`);
    }
  });
}
```

Using this function in the REPL:
```
> applyAndPrintResult(function double (n) { return 2 * n; }, 2)
Result successfully calculated:
Applying double to 2 gives 4

> applyAndPrintResult(function increment (n) { return n + 1; }, -4)
Result successfully calculated:
Applying increment to -4 gives -3

> applyAndPrintResult({}, 2)
Sorry, result could not be calculated:
Invalid argument: First argument is not a function

> applyAndPrintResult((n) => n, 2.3)
Sorry, result could not be calculated:
Invalid argument: Second argument 2.3 is not an integer
```

## Guidance
* This is the convention for handling errors when using callbacks for asynchronous control flow in Node. Try not to deviate from this pattern when writing async callback-based code.
* Structurally similar to returning errors in that it requires checks in the calling code.
* Maintain consistent interfaces; if a function requires a callback, do not also `throw` or `return` errors to the caller.
