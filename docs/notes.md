# Mentor Notes

Students needn't fully complete each section's exercise. Their purpose is primarily illustrative and to provide more concrete examples. The test files are also part of the illustration; they provide examples for how to test using each kind of approach.

Mentors should use their judgement, given their knowledge of the cohort, when deciding how much time to devote to these exercises. It may be that they decide to spend the whole workshop on these exercises and miss out the final exercise. Or it may by that they decide to skip quickly through the exercises, pointing out the solutions as resources that can be referred to while attempting the final exercise. Either approach could be appropriate depending on the level of the cohort.
